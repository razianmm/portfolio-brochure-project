      <h3>Tooling</h3>
      <p>
        As important as what is visual to the user, is the way in which the
        developer sets up his or her environment to accomplish a project's
        goals. Picking the right tools and technologies not only facilitates a
        developer's job, but also produce a more robust product overall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore it pays to have an idea of the tools at one's disposal, and to
        have an idea of where and why a specific tool is applicable.
      </p>
      <p>This project uses the following: Typescript, ESLint, Prettier.</p>
    </>
