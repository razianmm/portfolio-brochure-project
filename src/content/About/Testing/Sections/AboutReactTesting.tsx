      <h3>Automated Testing</h3>
      <p>
        Writing tests not only allows for more robust code on the back-end, but
        also allows for the same on the front-end.
      </p>
      <p>
        Several testing frameworks exist to make front-end code more robust.
        This site uses React Testing Library, which in turn uses Jest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Automated testing also allows us to test for whether our code meets
        accessibility best practices.
