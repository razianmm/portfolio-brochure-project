      This site is intended to demonstrate some basic knowledge of front end
      development best practices. It is not focused on content as much as
      context; from layout to color choices and keybaord navigability, it is
      built to demonstrate thorough knowledge of front end development best
      practices. In addition, this site is also demonstrative of some ancillary
      front end development technologies, most of which can be found at the
      Github link.
