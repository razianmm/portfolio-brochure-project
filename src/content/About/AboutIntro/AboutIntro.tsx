        Thanks for your visit! This site is intended to demonstrate some basic
        knowledge of front-end development best practices. It is not focused on
        content as much as context; from layout and design to color choices and
        keyboard navigability, it is built to demonstrate thorough knowledge of
        front-end development best practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, this site is also demonstrative of some ancillary front-end
        development technologies, including developer tooling and continous
        deployment.
