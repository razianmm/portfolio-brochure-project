      <h3>Animations</h3>
      <p>
        You may have noticed that this site contains a few animations; these
        give the site a bit more personality and create a pleasing visual effect
        for the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, for some users, animation can cause discomfort when viewed,
        such as motion sickness. Therefore, this site provides an option to
        toggle animations off. In addition, it also detects and abides by
        whether a user has set such preference on the system level.
