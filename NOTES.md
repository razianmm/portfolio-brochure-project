TO-DOs:

First iteration:

- Run an accessibility pass over whole site:
  - Improve accessibility of image section -- fallback if loading does not work? Can I make the image more responsive?
- Mobile styles - centralize breakpoints?
- Clean up site folders, fix imports
- Code cleanup - review copy, add links to site resources -- configs, source

Second interation:

- Additional sample pages?
- Tweak animations on home page to only play once
